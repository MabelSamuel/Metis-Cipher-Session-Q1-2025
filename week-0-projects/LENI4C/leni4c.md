# About Me

**Name**: Leni4c (Pronounced Leniac)

## Introduction
Professionally I am a web developer, in reality or rather what that translates to in real life is that i'm a problem solver, I take issues that'll bug people break it down debug it and sell that solution, either that's an e-commerce service, a landing page for wider reach, a system recording application, whatever that may be, I solve that and have fun while I do it

## Expectation
It's a programme organized by borderless so i've kept an open mind, one might say i've taken out the borders ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰, humor aside i'm a part of this because i'm looking to increase the range / field within which i'm able to create solutions

## Experience so far
The introduction has been indepth and enlightening i'm glad to have my path paved by these professionals and active participants of the web3 ecosystem
