# Week 6: Building a Voting Frontend and Integrating a Smart Contract

Welcome to Week 6 of our training program! This week, you will build a simple frontend for the voting smart contract you created in Week 4 and integrate it to enable users to interact with the contract through a web interface.

## Instructions for Week 6 Project

### Part 1: Build a Voting Frontend

1. **Create a simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React Vite is recommended).**
   - The frontend should allow users to:
     - Register as voters (if they meet the criteria).
     - Register as contestants.
     - Vote within the allowed voting period.
     - View the vote counts for each contestant.
     - View the total votes collected.
     - Display the final president-elect after the voting period ends.
   - Ensure that the UI is user-friendly and displays relevant messages to users.

2. **Integrate the Smart Contract**
   - Use **ethers.js** or **web3.js** or any other wallet connector to connect the frontend to the smart contract.
   - Implement the necessary contract function calls from the frontend.
   - Handle contract events and display relevant updates in real-time.

3. **Test on a Blockchain Testnet**
   - Deploy your frontend and test it with the smart contract on a testnet.
   - Ensure proper connection between the frontend and the deployed contract.
   - Debug and fix any issues encountered.

4. **Take Screenshots**
   - Capture a screenshot of the working frontend interface.
   - Capture a screenshot of successful transactions from the frontend to the blockchain.
   - Capture a screenshot of the smart contract logs on the blockchain explorer showing votes being counted.

5. **Document Your Work**
   - Create a `README.md` file inside your project folder.
   - Include your contract address, frontend setup instructions, and a short explanation of how the frontend interacts with the smart contract.
