## Solidity Assignment.
#### =
The "=" is used for variable assignment. 
For example, 
`int16 age = 14;`
Assigns the value of 24 to the variable "age" of type int16.

#### ==
This is used for comparison of values regardless of data type. For example,
```int16 pi = 3;
int32 e = 3;
pi == e;
```
This will return true because both values are 3. 

#### ===
This is used for strict comparison. It compares both the values and the data types. For example, using the same variables as above,
`pi === e`
This will return false because even the values are both 3, the data types of pi and e are int16 and int32 respectively: they are dissimilar.
